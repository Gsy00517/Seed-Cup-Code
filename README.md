# Seed Cup

Source code for the primary and final competition of Seed Cup. I used reinforcement learning for the primary competition and path finding for the final competition. Specifically, **Deep Q Network**, **Target Network** and **Dueling Network** were employed using Pytorch and **Breath First Search** and **A* Search** were also implemented. More details please refers to my code.
